# The-Business

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

DriverPass was the client, and they wanted a system to make scheduling driving lessons easy, track progress for users, and manage accounts. My goal was to design a user-friendly system that could handle all that while keeping things simple for both customers and staff.



What did you do particularly well?

   I think I did a great job on the UML diagrams. They were clear, detailed, and covered all the interactions the client needed. It was satisfying seeing everything come together visually.



If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

   If I could redo anything, I’d probably add more details to the technical requirements section. I think breaking down things like scalability and cloud integration in more depth would make the system feel even more complete.



How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  I relied on the interview transcript to figure out what the client needed. It helped me focus on features like lesson scheduling and role-based access. If you don’t design with the user in mind, the system won’t work the way they expect, which kind of defeats the purpose.



How do you approach designing software?

  I like to start by understanding what the user wants. Once that’s clear, I break it down into smaller steps, create diagrams, and get feedback along the way. Keeping things organized makes the whole process smoother.



What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

  In the future, I’d probably use more prototyping to test ideas early on. I’d also spend more time interviewing users to make sure I don’t miss anything important. Agile practices like sprint planning might also help keep things on track.
